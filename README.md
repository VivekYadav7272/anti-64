# Battery Percentage <img src="panel.png" align="right" alt="icon">

A GNOME shell extension to ban certain unholy numbers from embracing your eyes and make you unpure. I can't keep taking baths everytime I glare at my battery %age and find 64.

This is a fork of the excellent luispabon/gnome-shell-battery-time-and-percentage.

If you want just the battery percentage, gnome shell already can do that by itself. Run this on a terminal:
```
 gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface show-battery-percentage true
```

If you want just the battery time, use the original extension, [Battery Time](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1475/battery-time/)
